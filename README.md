## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- `lightningcss`
- Custom `build` script

### What I learned

Being much more intentional about CSS media queries and reducing overriding in the cascade. 

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
### Continued development

The next steps would be to make this card fit nicely into a grid for displaying multiple products on a page.
The button on the card would also need to lik to a product details and order page.
